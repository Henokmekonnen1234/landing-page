# Project: Web Page Layout  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a multi-section web page based on a provided design. You'll practice structuring HTML, styling with CSS, and reinforcing your understanding of flexbox.  

## Instructions  
### ðŸ“Œ Steps to Follow  
1. **Start with HTML** â€“ Add all the necessary content before applying styles.  
2. **Tackle one section at a time** â€“ The page consists of four main sections and a footer. Work on each individually.  
3. **Use CSS for styling** â€“ Reference the design images for colors, fonts, and layout. A single CSS file is sufficient.  
4. **Leverage flexbox** â€“ Many elements align similarly to previous flexbox exercises.  
5. **Focus on desktop layout** â€“ Mobile responsiveness is not required for this assignment.  
6. **Commit frequently** â€“ Follow best practices for Git commits.  
7. **Push to GitHub** â€“ Once complete, ensure your project is uploaded.
